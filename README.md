# Week 15.2: Docker Volumes & Networks

This project demonstrates how to use Docker volumes and networks in a Node.js + TypeScript application. The code is organized for hands-on learning and experimentation with Docker features.

## Project Structure

- `src/` — Source code (TypeScript)
- `Dockerfile` — Container build instructions
- `package.json` — Project dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Build and run with Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t week15-demo .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 week15-demo
   ```

## Docker Volumes

Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. In this project, you can experiment with mounting a volume to the container to keep your data even after the container is removed.

Example:
```bash
docker run -v mydata:/app/data week15-demo
```

## Docker Networks

Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other. You can create a custom network and attach containers to it for isolated communication.

Example:
```bash
docker network create mynetwork
docker run --network=mynetwork week15-demo
```

## Notes

- This project is for educational purposes and is kept intentionally simple.
- Feel free to modify the code and Docker setup to try out different scenarios.

Happy learning!
